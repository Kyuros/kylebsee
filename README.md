I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Florida J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering. I am driven by my fascination in coding and problem solving and want to develop the tools to unravel the intricacies in the brain. My work with [Dr. Ruogu Fang's SMILE Lab](https://lab-smile.github.io/index.html) involves machine learning and neuroscience focusing on understanding and predicting neural connections. My recent studies include classifying movement with functional magnetic resonance imaging and understanding spinal cord stimulation through electroencephalography.
